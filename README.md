# Chatbot (Using HTML, JavaScript and CSS)

This is a simple web-based chatbot application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate responses to user inputs. The chatbot interface is designed to be easily integrated into any webpage.

## Features

- Interactive chatbot with a user-friendly interface.
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate intelligent responses.
- Customizable appearance with CSS.

To use the OpenAI API, you need to provide your API key in the `script.js` file. Replace the placeholder API key with your actual key:

### Usage

1. **Toggle the chatbot**

   Click the chatbot toggle button at the bottom-right corner of the screen to open or close the chatbot interface.

2. **Send a message**

   Enter your message in the input area and press the send button (or press Enter). The chatbot will generate and display a response.

### HTML

The main structure of the chatbot is defined in the `index.html` file. It includes the button to toggle the chatbot, the chatbot container, and the chat input area.

### CSS

The styling is handled in the `style.css` file. This file includes styles for the chatbot container, chat messages, and responsive design.

### JavaScript

The functionality of the chatbot is implemented in the `script.js` file. It handles sending user messages, generating responses using the OpenAI API, and updating the chat interface.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the chatbot by editing the `style.css` and `script.js` files. For example, you can change the colors, fonts, and layout to match your website's design.
